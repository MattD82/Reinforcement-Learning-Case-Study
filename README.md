# Deep learning case study

The goal of this case study is to get some practice applying deep learning models to data.  Please select a case study from one of the options below.
<br/>
<br/>
### Option 1 generic title
Option 1 is amazing.  Everyone is doing it.  (Probably have a general dataset, like churn, that could be analyzed with many tools, including an MLP.

<br/>
<br/>
### Option 2 generic title
The only thing better than Option 1 is Option 2.  (A datasets like Cifar-10 that has image classifiction using a CNN would be good here)

### Option 3 generic title
Option 3 is better than 2! (An RNN, sequence dataset, probably something with text)

### Deliverables

At the end of the day your group will be expected to present for 5
minutes on your findings.  You can do this directly from your Jupyter
notebooks.

Cover the following in your presentation.

   1. Talk about what you planned to accomplish
   2. How you organized yourselves as a team
   3. What architecture you chose and why
   4. What final architecture you chose and why (how did you pick your hyperparameters?)
   5. How measured your model's performance
   6. Things learned along the way.
