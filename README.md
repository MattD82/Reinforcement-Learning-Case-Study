## The Goal:
The goal of this case study was to use reinforcement learning to train an agent to perform well in an environment using the OpenAI Gym [source]/(https://gym.openai.com/envs/). Based on our time constraints, we chose to tackle one of the classic environments:

## The Plan:
   1. Talk about what you planned to accomplish
   2. How you organized yourselves as a team


## Implementing our code:
   3. What architecture you chose and why
   4. What final architecture you chose and why (how did you pick your hyperparameters?)
