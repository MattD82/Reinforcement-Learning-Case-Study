# Deep learning case study
## Authors: Matt Devor, Nathan James, Rosie Martinez & Neha Rao

## The Goal:
The goal of this case study was to use reinforcement learning to train an agent to perform well in an environment using the OpenAI Gym [source]/(https://gym.openai.com/envs/). Based on our time constraints, we chose to tackle one of the classic environments:

### Do you want to play a game?
Select an [environment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/) in OpenAI Gym and train an agent to perform well in the environment.  Beware of the complexity and training time associated with the video games.  The [Leaderboard](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard) may contain a solution for your environment that you could start with.  Be prepared to talk in-depth about your agent, the environment, actions, states, rewards, q-learning and your resulting policy.


## Presentations
At the end of the day your group will be expected to present for 5-10 minutes on your findings.  Please present from your group's Github README.md.

Cover the following in your presentation.

   1. Talk about what you planned to accomplish
   2. How you organized yourselves as a team
   3. What architecture you chose and why
   4. What final architecture you chose and why (how did you pick your hyperparameters?)
   5. How measured your model's performance
   6. Things learned along the way.
