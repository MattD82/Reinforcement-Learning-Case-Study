# Deep learning case study

The goal of this case study is to get some practice applying deep learning models to data.  Please select a case study from one of the options below.
<br/>
<br/>
### Revisit an old case study with new tools
You used linear regression to predict [heavy equipment auction sale prices](https://github.com/gSchool/ds-case-study-linear-models/blob/master/predict_auction_price/README.md), and non-parametric models to predict if someone would [churn from a ride-sharing company](https://github.com/gSchool/dsi-ml-case-study).  Choose one of these old case-studies and use a neural net to get a solution instead.  Compare and contrast your neural network solution with the more standard machine learning models.  Where did it do well?  Where did it do worse?  Was it as easy to train?  How do you interpret your results?  This case case should give you perspective on the advantages and disadvantages of neural networks.

### Definitely *not* MNIST
The [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is so 1998.  In 2011 Yaroslav Bulatov made the [notMNIST dataset](http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.com/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html).  There are still 10 classes, but instead of numbers 0 - 9 you are classifying letters A - J of many different font styles.  Note that there are large and small tarball compressed (.tar.gz) datasets of .png files for you process (starting small!).

### Option 3 generic title
Option 3 is better than 2! (An RNN, sequence dataset, probably something with text)

### Option 4 or more generic title
And more etc.

### Deliverables

At the end of the day your group will be expected to present for 5
minutes on your findings.  You can do this directly from your Jupyter
notebooks.

Cover the following in your presentation.

   1. Talk about what you planned to accomplish
   2. How you organized yourselves as a team
   3. What architecture you chose and why
   4. What final architecture you chose and why (how did you pick your hyperparameters?)
   5. How measured your model's performance
   6. Things learned along the way.
